# Portfolio Website with JSON Content Management

## How to Update Content

2. **Personal**: Contains personal information like name, title, location, contact details, and social media links.
3. **About**: Contains information about yourself, including bio, professional focus, languages, and interests.
4. **Navigation**: Contains the navigation menu items.

6. **Credentials**: Contains your certifications, education, and skills.

## Adding Images

To add or update images:

1. Place your image files in the `public` directory.
2. Update the paths in the JSON file to point to your new images.

## Projects

Projects are managed separately in the `lib/projects.ts` file. You can update this file to add, remove, or modify projects.

## Development

To run the development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
\`\`\`

This refactoring allows users to update all content through the JSON file without modifying the codebase. The components now dynamically read from this data source, making content updates easier and more manageable.
